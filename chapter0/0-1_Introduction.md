On a typical computing device
- A CPU executes the program
- Memory loads programs prior to execution
- Storage devices retain information even when the computer is turned off


The act of modifying a program so it runs on a different platform (like Mac) is porting




# Machine Language

A computer's CPU reads programs in machine langauge (just binary)

Each individual 0 or 1 is a binary digit, or bit. Each family of CPUs has its own machine langauge (ex. x86's language is different from Arm64)

An assembler converts Assembly code into machine code

C++ programs are compiled, source code -> assembly -> machine language



High-level language source code -> Compiler -> Executable
Executable -> Hardware -> Produces results of the program
